Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the time duration the application is down.
It is calculated according to availability percentage stated in the SLA. 

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the time duration where new data is not recorded and as such lost.
It is calculated according to the database backup strategy.

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Time	Description
00:01	Problem happens (First minute)
00:06	An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 mins)
00:07	Automatically switch to second availability zone (1 mins)

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RDS has a point in time restoration that uploads transactions every 5 minutes. 
As such, the most data lost will be 5 minutes of data.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Read replicas aim to be kept up to date with the primary DB so the read replica should have almost the same RPO as the primary DB. 
For some critical cases we can consider RPO should be at most 10 mins.
